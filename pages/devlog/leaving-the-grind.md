# Leaving the Grind
## or work to live

We've all heard about the Grind, you need to grind to be successful! You pour your heart into the work you do, everything you do is to further yourself or your company. 

You sacrifice free time to gain knowledge or experience in your field. You spend evenings and lunches doing talks and holding interviews so you can show your colleagues that you are constantly improving.
