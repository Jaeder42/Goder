# App Cowboys
## or the greatest team

In the old west, there stood an old town. At one point this was place was new and exciting, people would pass through and talk about what a great time they had. But as the years went by, the town only added things and never rebuilt anything. Soon the town was a patchwork of fixes, built by different inhabitants over time. Some signs were just painted over, windows replaced by planks and the inhabitants all worked around the clock to keep everything running!

This is where our team of App Cowboys come in...

# The Señor
The rugged and battle hardened dev. He wasn't there at the beginning but everyone knows that he has fixed every part of the town at some point, he knows every corner of the town.

# The Intern
He joined the team, because the boss took a chance on him. No question an asset from day one! Some would say his Cowboy antics were legendary.

# The Dreamer
He sees this town for what it could be! He wants to help anyone with the problems they have now, but also dreams of the day the town can be rebuilt..

# The Artist
Not everything needs to be function over form, even in a run down town like this. She wants visitors to find their way to the local saloon without having to ask directions.

# The [Scrum]
Someone needs to keep track of all these Cowboys running around, sure they all say they're working on something, but she has a way of getting everyone focused on what is most important right now!

# The [Tester]
Hey does that door open anymore? Why does this wall have a doorknob? Somehow the bar is being tended by a cow from the nearby farm.. She has a way of finding all the ways someone screwed something up, usually before any visitors notice anything!

# The [Fullstack]
Someone needs to just get down and dirty, get that cow out of the saloon... He just rolls up his sleeves and gets shit done.

# The Wrecking Ball
Why fix something if it's too broken? Someone gave this man a license to start building the Town 2.0...


# The story
The Cowboys all came in to this town at different times, they all saw the state of the town and still they stayed. The inhabitants were friendly and welcoming, and even with pressures from the bank about loans that needed to be payed, everyone did what they could.
At several points they discussed if the should steal the SAFE from the bank and be free to work in their own pace on things they felt passionate about... but they never came up with a good enough plan...
One day, the Cowboys were given an opportunity, build Town 2.0, or TownX as it came to be known. The trade off? They needed to built certain parts first, the bank needed some more high end rooms than the local saloon could offer, for their more premium customers.
Well that was a small price to pay for the opportunity to build their very own town, a place that they could take real ownership and pride in! As they started working out the permits and assigning plots for all the different parts of the town, they realized that they could leverage some of the skills of the nearby towns in the state. They got help planning and even supplies from the neighbouring towns. For the first time in several years they were a real part of their own community, and people were really excited for the grand opening!
As the work was nearing completion, the Wrecking Ball had to leave. His family needed him.
He had started the work, laid as good of a foundation as he could, probably ruffled some feathers of people who did not agree with his vision and hopefully made some friends along the way..

But he left the town in the most capable hands imaginable!

As he left he looked back at what they had built, even with the scaffolding still upp he could see the potential of what the town could be, but also the hard work of some of the best team members he had ever worked with.
