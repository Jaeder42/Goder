# The new to a codebase cycle
## or how I get comfortable

Getting started working in a brand new codebase, especially one that has been around for a while, is always a bit of a challenge. It's like walking into a building you've never been in. People seem to know exactly where to go, and how to handle every quirky lock on the mislabeled doors. 

I've felt like this a number of times in my career. I've joined teams near a major release, where everyone is focusing on getting things shipped, and I've joined teams struggling with years of tech debt. And in both these cases you feel equally lost, wether someone needs help building that last step of an onboarding or someone updated some content that broke one of the views that you now need to fix! 

Every team and company is different but I've noticed my brain doing the same thing over and over, which is why I want to write it down and remind myself that everything takes time. Hopefully this can also help you, whoever you are reading this currently!

### Day 1
Setup day! You are being rushed through introductions while trying to setup your development environment. Hopefully you've got enough access to actually get some code in your IDE. At this stage you should be getting a very broad overview of HOW the system is setup, but you are in no way even close to seeing the connections between systems. 

### Day 10
All right, you've got some code into the codebase, easy low hanging fruit, but it's something. At this point you've already run into some pain points: "Why did we set it up like this?", "How can this even work?" are questions that feel familiar. You are beginning to ask questions about how the systems works in a bigger context. 

### Day 30

You are now comfortable doing debugging with little information, you are now involved with new features in a real sense!
