#Fuck Agile
## Long live agile

Woah, aggressive! But also, what? Yeah well I think it's time to reclaim agile. One of the original points in the Agile manifesto was: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools". But if I say scrum, a very popular Agile framework, you immediately think of meetings and processes that you will have to participate in. And as the the original authors state: "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more", meaning they did not mean to remove all processes but that they should come second to individuals and interactions.

I know many people can relate to my gut reaction that frameworks like scrum seem antithetical to people over processes. And I do believe that we are in a place where we put a lot of trust in our processes, so much so that we forget why we use them. Take the retrospective meeting in scrum, where you are encouraged to think of things that went well and less well.
